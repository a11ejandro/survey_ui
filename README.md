# Survey UI.

This is a source code of Web-UI client for API described in article [Comparing the performance of RoR and Go applications in the background processing](https://medium.com/@alexander.potrakhov/comparing-the-performance-of-ror-and-go-applications-in-computation-heavy-tasks-85140bda1e6b). Created with [react-scripts-ts](https://github.com/wmonk/create-react-app-typescript).

The application is pointless without running [API](https://github.com/a11ejandro/rails_survey_calculator) and [Go worker](https://github.com/a11ejandro/golang_survey_calculator), set them up first if you haven't.
